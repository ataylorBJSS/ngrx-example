# NgrxExample

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.8.

An example of using ngrx-store and ngrx-entity for state management.
## ngrx/store

[Github] (https://github.com/ngrx/platform/tree/master/docs/store)
RxJS powered state management for Angular applications, inspired by Redux

I found this to be a simpler implementation of redux but still allowed a good level of explicity, immutablity and easier testing with pure functions.

## ngrx/dev-tools
[github](https://github.com/ngrx/platform/tree/master/docs/store-devtools)
Dev tools for rxjs-store

## ngrx/entity

[Github] (https://github.com/ngrx/platform/tree/master/docs/entity)
Entity State adapter for managing record collections.

This removes boilerplate code from your reducers by providing an adapter to performant functions.
I'm not sure if the selectors are cached yet, it would make sense...right?

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
